# Zen Mode

Introducing Zen Mode! This incredibly simple mod adds 3 toggles to hide 3 features of the game: 

-	The Leaderboard on every level/rush
-	The “Global Neon Ranking” button in Believer’s Park
-	The hour count above the “Continue” button in the main menu


If you want to compete with yourself, and only yourself, it doesn’t get easier than literally not being able to see anyone else’s time. This is mainly a personal project for me, wanting to enjoy the game more without the pressure of seeing that number go up, or not climbing ranks on PBs. I figured there were at least some players who would like not dealing with the added competition of leaderboards.

Sidenote: obviously the Leaderboard toggle is not SRC variable. Disable it and the run should be.
